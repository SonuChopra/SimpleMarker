# SimpleMarker
     
Have you ever wanted to quickly save a URL while browsing but find bookmarking too complicated? Well, that's why SimpleMarker was created–– to make bookmarking as simple as a click of a button. No really, literally just a button! After you download this extension, you can click on the SimpleMarker icon and the URL will be saved on the pop up screen. Moreover, you drag-and-drop bookmarks into folders to make them more organized and easily accessible. However, that isn’t even the most exciting feature of this extension. Our unique extension allows you to highlight text on a webpage and save that text as the URL, which you can also edit to fit your needs. This makes it easy to identify what information caught your eye in the first place that led you to bookmarking that website. The best part of the feature is that when you click on the text days later, it will scroll down to the text you highlighted automatically. This extension is great for anyone from highs school students to researchers. Please watch the video guide on the extension to get the most out of this simple, but powerful tool.  

 Key Features:
- Binds your bookmarks with your gmail account
